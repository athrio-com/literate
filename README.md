## What it is

You write one `.loom` file in which prose and code live together, in the order
that best explains the program. From that single source `loom` **tangles** the
code into real source files on disk, and serves the same file to your editor as
a live language — type-checked, navigable and highlighted, section by section.

The idea is Knuth's: a program as a work of literature, where the prose is not a
comment on the code but the code's other half. Loom is language-agnostic — a
document names its primary language, and any section may switch.

## Install

Node 20 or newer, or Bun 1.2 or newer.

```sh
npm install -g @athrio/loom
```

```sh
# scaffold a workspace
loom init

# tangle a .loom file, or a directory of them, into real source
loom tangle greeting.loom

# start the language server for any editor that speaks LSP
loom lsp --stdio
```

`loom --help` lists the rest.
